Operation T1: Transformation 'map', so as to get a new RDD ('wordsRDD') from inputRDD.\n    # The transformation operation 'flatMap' is a higher order function.\n    # It requires as input arguments: (i) A function F and (ii) a collection of items C.\n    # It produces as output argument a new collection C' by applying F to each element of C.\n    # What makes flatMap different from map is that the collection C' is flattened.\n\n    # So, in our case, RDD2 is not going to be a collection of 2 items (each of them of type [String]).\n    # Instead, RDD2 is going to be a collection of 8 items (each of them of type String).\n    # This is because, after performing the entire map process, the resulting collection is flattened.\n\n    #         C1: parallelize             T1: flatMap\n    # dataset -----------------> inputRDD ------------> wordsRDD\n\n    wordsRDD = inputRDD.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(\" \"))\n\n    # 3.

Thus, it will be computed just once.\n\n    # In any case, persist can store the RDD in memory or in disk (or in a combination of both).\n    # If it stores the RDD in memory, it does it by storing it in the heap area of the JVM of the executor process of each node.\n\n    #         C1: parallelize             T1: flatMap            P1: persist    ------------\n    # dataset -----------------> inputRDD ------------> wordsRDD -------------> | wordsRDD |\n    #                                                                           ------------\n\n    wordsRDD.persist()\n\n    # 4.
